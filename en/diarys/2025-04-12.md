> China Inner Mongolia Chifeng City / Finally turning negative / 9˚C

Feeling irritable, unable to complete the schedule normally, unknown reason

1. After learning CI/CD, the robot can now run continuously, which is still a good thing

2. Learned MikuMikuDance and became inspired to become a major player in Kachu（

3. I was strongly comforted by my friend (although the comfort was a bit radical, it was still a true friend)

4. Update your small cloud storage to the latest program, it looks great and gives me a little sense of achievement

5. Why do the songs in my online storage still sound so good. I've been listening for several hours now

I don't know why, sometimes it feels uncomfortable to be comforted by friends or to be asked for help by friends

**I may be quite arrogant, right**
